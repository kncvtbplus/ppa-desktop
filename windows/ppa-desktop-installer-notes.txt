PPA Desktop installation completed
=================================

Thank you for installing **PPA Desktop**.

- A simple step-by-step user guide has been installed at:
  `{app}\windows\ppa-desktop-user-guide.txt`
- We recommend opening this guide in **Notepad** and keeping it nearby while you work.

On the final installer screen you can choose to open the guide immediately.  
Later, you can always open it again via Notepad or from the installed files.
