PPA Desktop – important information before installation
======================================================

- PPA Desktop itself requires roughly 300 MB of disk space.
- **Docker Desktop** is required and typically needs **at least 3 GB** of free disk space for installation and images.
- Docker Desktop may ask you to create or sign in to a Docker account, but **this is not required for PPA Desktop**:
  you can choose the option to skip account creation / sign-in and continue using Docker without logging in.

Make sure you have sufficient free disk space before continuing. After Docker Desktop is installed once on your
computer, it can be reused for future PPA Desktop updates.
